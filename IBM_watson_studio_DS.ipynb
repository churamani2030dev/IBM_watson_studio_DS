Here lies the challenge in both performing and presenting an analysis. As\\r\\ndata scientists, analysts, and machine learning engineers faced with fulfilling\\r\\nbusiness objectives, we find ourselves bridging the gap between The Two Cultures : sciences and humanities. After spending countless hours at the terminal\\r\\ndevising a creative and elegant solution to a difficult problem, the insights\\r\\nand business applications are obvious in our minds. But how do you distill them\\r\\ninto something you can communicate?\\r\\n\\r\\nQualifications and requirements for a senior data scientist position.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresenting my work is one of the surprising challenges I faced in my recent\\r\\ntransition from academia to life as a data analyst at a market research and strategy firm . When I was a linguistics PhD student at UCLA studying learnability theory in\\r\\na classroom or measuring effects of an oral constriction on glottal vibration in\\r\\na sound booth, my colleagues and I were comfortable speaking the same language.\\r\\nNow that I work with a much more diverse crowd of co-workers and clients with\\r\\nvaried backgrounds and types of expertise, I need to work harder to ensure that\\r\\nthe insights of my analyses are communicated effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this second entry in the communicating data science series , I cover some essentials when it comes to presenting a thorough,\\r\\ncomprehensible analysis for readers who want (or need) to know how to get their\\r\\nwork noticed and read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nGET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME\\r\\nImagine you\\u2019ve just completed the so-called heavy lifting, whatever it may be,\\r\\nand you\\u2019re ready to present your results and conclusions in a report. Well, step\\r\\naway from the word processor! There are two things you must first consider: your\\r\\naudience and your goals. This is your forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHO IS YOUR AUDIENCE?\\r\\nThe matter of who you\\u2019re speaking to will influence every detail of how you\\r\\nchoose to present your analysis from whether you use technical jargon or spend\\r\\ntime carefully defining your terms. The formality of the context may determine\\r\\nwhether a short, fun tangent or personal anecdote will keep your audience\\r\\nhappily engaged or elicit eye rolls \\u2026 and worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is all important to consider because once you\\u2019ve envisioned your audience,\\r\\nyou take stock of what may and may not be shared knowledge and how to manage\\r\\ntheir expectations. In your writing (and in everyday life), it\\u2019s useful to be\\r\\ncognizant of Grice\\u2019s principles of cooperative communication:\\r\\n\\r\\n 1. Maxim of quantity : be informative, without giving overwhelming amounts of extraneous detail.\\r\\n 2. Maxim of quality : be truthful. Enough said.\\r\\n 3. Maxim of relation : be relevant. I\\u2019ll give you some tips on staying topical shortly!\\r\\n 4. Maxim of manner : be clear. Don\\u2019t be ambiguous, be orderly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo be cooperative! Know your audience and do what you can to anticipate their\\r\\nexpectations. This will ensure that you cover all ground in exactly as much\\r\\ndetail as necessary in your report.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT IS THE GOAL?\\r\\nAlso before you put pen to paper, it\\u2019s helpful remind yourself again (and again)\\r\\nof what your goal is. If you\\u2019re working in a professional environment, you\\u2019re\\r\\naware that it\\u2019s important to be continually mindful of the goal or business\\r\\nproblem and why you\\u2019re tasked with solving it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr perhaps it's a strategic initiative you're after: Did you set out to learn\\r\\nsomething new about some data (and the world)? Or have you been diligently\\r\\nworking on a new skill you\\u2019d like to showcase? Do you want to test out some\\r\\nideas and get feedback? It\\u2019s okay to make it your goal to find out \\u201cCan I do\\r\\nthis?\\u201d Maybe you want to share some of your expertise with the community on\\r\\nKaggle Scripts. In that case, it\\u2019s even more imperative that you have a\\r\\nbuttoned-up analysis!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"If we can really understand the problem, the answer will come out of it,\\r\\nbecause the answer is not separate from the problem.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2015 Jiddu KrishnamurtiIf you\\u2019ve reached the point of having an analysis to report, you\\u2019ve more than\\r\\nlikely familiarized yourself with the goals of the initiative, but you must also\\r\\nkeep them at the forefront of your thoughts when presenting your results as\\r\\nwell. Your work should be contextualized in terms of your understanding of the\\r\\nresearch objectives. Often in my own day job this means synthesizing many\\r\\nanalyses I\\u2019ve performed into a few key pieces of evidence which support a story;\\r\\nthis can\\u2019t be done well except by accident without keeping in mind the ultimate\\r\\nobjective at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PREAMBLE\\r\\nNow that you\\u2019ve got yourself in the right frame of mind\\u2015you can see the forest\\r\\nand you know the trees\\u2015you\\u2019re ready to start thinking about the content of your\\r\\nreport. However, before you start furiously spilling ink, first remind yourself\\r\\nof the three elements required to ask an askable question in science:\\r\\n\\r\\n 1. The question itself along with some justification of how it addresses your\\r\\n    objectives\\r\\n 2. A hypothesis\\r\\n 3. A feasible methodology for addressing your question\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch as I implore you to consider who your audience is and what your objectives\\r\\nare in order to get your mind in the right place, I\\u2019m recommending that you have\\r\\nthe answers to these three things ready because they will dictate the content of\\r\\nyour report. You don\\u2019t want to throw everything and the kitchen sink into a\\r\\nreport!\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S THE QUESTION?\\r\\nOn Kaggle, the competition hosts very generously provide their burning questions\\r\\nto the community. Outside of this environment, the challenge is to come up with\\r\\none on your own or work within the business objectives of your employer. At this\\r\\npoint, you make sure that you can appropriately state the question and how it\\r\\nrelates to your objective(s).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an aside, if you need some exercise in the area of asking insightful\\r\\nquestions (a skill unto its own), I hereby challenge you to scroll through some\\r\\nof Kagglers\\u2019 most recent scripts, find and read one, and think of one new\\r\\nquestion you could ask the author. If you find that this is a stumbling block\\r\\npreventing you from proceeding with your analysis, many dataset publishers\\r\\ninclude a number of questions they\\u2019d like to see addressed. Or read the Script of the Week blogs and see what other ideas script authors would like to see explored in the same\\r\\ndataset.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S THE ANSWER?\\r\\nNow that you have your question, what do you think the answer will be? It\\u2019s good\\r\\npractice, of course, to consider what the possible answers may be before you dig\\r\\ninto the data, so hopefully you\\u2019ve already done that! Clearly delimiting the\\r\\nhypothesis space at this point will guide the evidence and arguments you use in\\r\\nthe body of your report. It will be easier to evaluate what constitutes weak and\\r\\nstrong support of your theory and what analyses may be absolutely irrelevant.\\r\\nUltimately you will prevent yourself from attacking straw men in faux support of your theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon't build straw men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S YOUR METHODOLOGY?\\r\\nLet\\u2019s say you\\u2019re asking whether Twitter users with dense social networks in the How ISIS Uses Twitter dataset express greater negative sentiment than users with less dense networks. Your\\r\\nfirst step is to confirm that the data available is sufficient to address your\\r\\nresearch question. If there\\u2019s major missing information, you may want to rethink\\r\\nyour question, revise your methodology, or even collect new data.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\u2019re unsure of how to put language to a particular methodology, this is a\\r\\ngood opportunity to flex your Googling skills. Search for \\u201csocial network\\r\\nanalysis in r\\u201d or \\u201csentiment analysis in python.\\u201d Dive into some academic papers\\r\\nif it's appropriate and see how it's presented. Peruse the natural language processing tags on No Free Hunch and read the winners\\u2019 interviews . Get inspiration from scripts on similar datasets on Kaggle. For example, a similar analysis was performed by Kaggle user Khomutov Nikita using the Hillary Clinton\\u2019s Emails dataset .\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary Clinton's network graph. See the code here .\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if you don\\u2019t end up needing to share every nuance of your methodology with\\r\\nyour given audience, you should always document your work thoroughly to the\\r\\nextent possible. Once you\\u2019re ready to present your analysis, you\\u2019ll be capable\\r\\nof determining how much is the right amount to share when discussing the nitty\\r\\ngritty mechanics of your model. Similarly, I've been able to pleasantly surprise\\r\\nmy boss many times because I have an answer ready at-hand for immediate\\r\\nquestions thanks to keeping my exploratory analyses well-documented.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the way, if you\\u2019ve felt overwhelmed by the task of putting together a solid\\r\\nmethodology for tackling a question, it can\\u2019t hurt to lob an idea and some code\\r\\nto the community for feedback. Especially once you have solid presentation of\\r\\nanalysis skills! Be honest about where you feel you could use extra input and\\r\\nmaybe a fellow Kaggler will come forth with different angle on the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER\\r\\nFinally, you\\u2019re ready to write. Keep in mind that a good analysis should\\r\\nfacilitate its own interpretation as much as possible. Again, this requires\\r\\nanticipating what information your likely audience will be seeking and what\\r\\nknowledge they\\u2019re coming in with already. One method which is both\\r\\ntried-and-true and friendly to the academic nature of the discipline is\\r\\nfollowing a template for your analysis. With that, this section covers the\\r\\nstructure which when fleshed out will help you tell the story in the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep in mind that a good analysis should facilitate its own interpretation as\\r\\nmuch as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOT SO ABSTRACT\\r\\nMake it easy for your audience to quickly determine what they\\u2019re about to\\r\\ndigest. Use an abstract or introduction to recall your objectives and clearly\\r\\nstate them for your readers. What is the problem that you\\u2019ve set out to solve?\\r\\nIf you have a desired outcome or any expectations of your audience, say it, as\\r\\nthis is the entire reason you\\u2019re presenting them with your analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou then cover everything from your preamble in this section: the question\\r\\nyou\\u2019ve been on a mission to answer, your hypothesis, and the methodology you\\u2019ve\\r\\nused. Finally, you will often provide a high level summary of your results and\\r\\nkey findings. Don\\u2019t worry about spoiler alerts or boring your readers to death\\r\\nwith the content that\\u2019s about to follow. Trust that if they pay attention past\\r\\nthe introduction that they are interested in how you achieve what you claim you\\r\\nhave.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people I've talked to have said that they often find it easier to write the\\r\\nabstract after having already completely documented the detailed findings of the analysis. I\\r\\nthink that this is at least in part because you've familiarized yourself with\\r\\nyour own work through the lens of your readership by doing so. Slowly but surely\\r\\nyou're extracting yourself from the trees and the bigger picture becomes\\r\\napparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CONTENT: BREAK OFF WHAT YOU CAN CHEW\\r\\nThis is where the good stuff lives. You've laid the foundation for your analysis\\r\\nsuch that your audience is prepared to read or listen intently to your story. I\\r\\ncan\\u2019t tell you the specifics of what goes here, but I can tell you how to\\r\\nstructure it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake your analysis in small bits by breaking your question into subparts. For a\\r\\ndata-driven analysis, it can make sense to tackle each piece of evidence\\r\\none-by-one. You may have a dissertation\\u2019s worth of data to report on, but more\\r\\nlikely than not you must pick and choose what will best support your analysis\\r\\nsuccinctly and effectively. Again, having the objectives and audience in mind\\r\\nwill help you decide what\\u2019s critical. Lay it all out before you and pair\\r\\nsub-questions with evidence until you have a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you\\u2019ve presented the evidence, explain why it supports (or doesn't support)\\r\\nyour hypothesis or your objectives. A good analysis also considers alternative\\r\\nhypotheses or interpretations as well. You\\u2019ve already surveyed the hypothesis\\r\\nspace, so you should be ready-armed to handle contrary evidence. Doing so is\\r\\nalso a way of anticipating the expectations of your audience and the skepticism\\r\\nthey may harbor. It\\u2019s at this point that it\\u2019s most critical to keep in mind your\\r\\nobjectives and the question you\\u2019re addressing with your analysis. Ask how every\\r\\npiece of evidence you offer takes you one step closer to confirming or\\r\\ndisproving your hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER TIPS AND TRICKS\\r\\nVisualize the problem . Seeing is believing. It\\u2019s cliched to say in any statement asserting the value\\r\\nof data visualization, but it\\u2019s so incredibly true. This \\u201ctrick\\u201d is so effective\\r\\nthat I\\u2019m going to spend more time talking about it in a future post. If you can\\r\\nplainly \\u201cstate\\u201d something with a graph or chart, go for it!\\r\\n\\r\\n * Shail Jayesh Deliwala visualizes confusion matrices to evaluate and compare model performance.\\r\\n   Read the full notebook here .\\\" /\\r\\n * Lj Miranda shows the steady rise of carbon emissions in the Philippines.

Read the full notebook here .\\\" /\\r\\n\\r\\nVariety is the spice of life . And it can liven up your writing (and speaking) as well. For example, use a\\r\\nmix of short and sweet sentences interspersed among longer, more elaborate ones.\\r\\nFind where you accidentally used the word \\u201cdidactic\\u201d four times on one page and\\r\\nchange it up! Related to my first point, use effective variety in types of\\r\\nvisualizations you employ. Small things like this will keep your readers awake\\r\\nand interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheck your work . I don\\u2019t like to emphasize this too much because I\\u2019m a descriptivist , but make sure your writing is grammatical, fluent, and free of typos. For\\r\\nbetter or worse, trivial mistakes can discredit you in the eyes of many. I find\\r\\nthat it helps to read my writing aloud to catch disfluencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nGain muscle memory . If you really struggle with transforming your analysis into a form that can\\r\\nbe shared more broadly, begin by writing anything until writing prose feels as natural as writing code. For example, I actually\\r\\nsuggest sitting down and copying a report word-for-word. Or even any instance of\\r\\npersuasive writing. Not to be used as your own in any way (i.e., plagiarism),\\r\\nbut to remove one more unknown from the equation: what it literally feels like to go through the motions of stringing words and sentences and paragraphs\\r\\ntogether to tell a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCLUSIONS & NEXT STEPS\\r\\nA good analysis is repetitive. You know the intricacies of your work in and out,\\r\\nbut your audience does not. You\\u2019ve told your readers in your abstract (or\\r\\nintroduction, if you prefer) what you had ventured to do and even what you end\\r\\nup finding and the content lays this all out for them. In the conclusions\\r\\nsection you hit them with it again. At this point, they\\u2019ve seen the relevant\\r\\ndata you\\u2019ve carefully chosen to support your theory so it\\u2019s time to formally\\r\\ndraw your conclusions. Your readers can decide if they agree or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of being repetitive, after making your conclusions, you again remind\\r\\nyour readers of the objective(s) of this report. Restate them again and help\\r\\nyour readers help you\\u2015what do you expect now? What feedback would you like? What\\r\\ndecision-making can happen now that your report is presented and the insights\\r\\nhave been shared? In my work, I often collaborate with strategists to develop a\\r\\nset of recommendations for our clients. Typically I'll take a stab at it based\\r\\non the expertise I've gained in working with the data and a strategist will\\r\\nrefine using their business insights.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIN\\r\\nAnd this is exactly where the beauty of the analysis and your skillful\\r\\npresentation thereof meet. Because you\\u2019ve managed to package your approach in a\\r\\nfashion digestible to your audience, your readers, collaborators, and clients\\r\\nhave comprehended and learned from your analysis and what its implications are\\r\\nwithout getting lost in the trees. They are equipped to react to the value in\\r\\nyour work and participate in the next step of realizing its objectives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for reading the second entry in this series on communicating data science . I covered the basics of presenting an analysis at a very high level. I'd love\\r\\nto learn what your approach is, how you realize the value in your work, and how\\r\\nyou collaborate with others to achieve business goals.

Trying to summarize it ended up being quite long\\r\\n   anyway. A lot of distilled information.\\r\\n   \\r\\n   We work a bit differently. We include an executive summary + recommendations\\r\\n   at the beginning of the presentation instead of putting them at the end, just\\r\\n   after stating the question to answer. After that the audience knows what will\\r\\n   come, and when the presentation is revisited it is a lot faster to check . If\\r\\n   there's a need to dig deeper, there's always available all the analysis\\r\\n   steps.\\r\\n   \\r\\n   Hoping to see the next one soon! \\ud83d\\ude00\\r\\n   \\r\\n    * Megan RisdalThanks! I actually often do the same thing re: executive summaries in my\\r\\n      day job, too! That's a really good point. There's definitely no\\r\\n      one-size-fits-all approach which makes a high-level summarization\\r\\n      misleading in certain ways. And now that I think of it, another strength\\r\\n      in communicating data science is being able to be information dense &\\r\\n      concise for times where you need to fit your work into a standalone one-\\r\\n      or two-sheeter/executive summary.\\r\\n      \\r\\n      Hopefully more good stuff coming soon. \\ud83d\\ude42\\r\\n      \\r\\n      \\r\\n    * \\r\\n   \\r\\n   \\r\\n * \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OFFICIAL BLOG OF KAGGLE.COM\\r\\nSearchCATEGORIES\\r\\n * Data Science News (38)\\r\\n * Kaggle News (120)\\r\\n * Kernels (22)\\r\\n * Tutorials (28)\\r\\n * Winners' Interviews (174)\\r\\n\\r\\nWANT TO SUBSCRIBE?\\r\\nEmail Address * First Name * = required fieldPOPULAR TAGS\\r\\nAlgo Trading Challenge Annual Santa Competition binary classification community computer vision CrowdFlower Search Results Relevance Dark Matter Deloitte diabetes Diabetic Retinopathy EEG data Elo Chess Ratings Competition Eurovision Challenge Facebook Recruiting Flavours of Physics: Finding \\u03c4 \\u2192 \\u03bc\\u03bc\\u03bc Flight Quest Grasp-and-Lift EEG Detection Heritage Health Prize How Much Did It Rain? image classification Intel Kaggle InClass Kernels logistic regression March Mania Merck multiclass classification natural language processing optimization problem Otto Product Classification Owen Zhang Practice Fusion Product Product News Profiling Top Kagglers Recruiting regression problem scikit-learn scripts of the week The Hunt for Prohibited Content Tourism Forecasting Tutorial video series Wikipedia Challenge XGBoostARCHIVES\\r\\nArchives Select Month July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 Toggle the Widgetbar\",\n          \"Skip navigation Sign in SearchLoading...\\r\\n\\r\\nClose Yeah, keep it Undo CloseTHIS VIDEO IS UNAVAILABLE.\\r\\nWATCH QUEUE\\r\\nQUEUE\\r\\nWatch Queue Queue * Remove all\\r\\n * Disconnect\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next video is starting stop 1.

Here lies the challenge in both performing and presenting an analysis. As\\r\\ndata scientists, analysts, and machine learning engineers faced with fulfilling\\r\\nbusiness objectives, we find ourselves bridging the gap between The Two Cultures : sciences and humanities. After spending countless hours at the terminal\\r\\ndevising a creative and elegant solution to a difficult problem, the insights\\r\\nand business applications are obvious in our minds. But how do you distill them\\r\\ninto something you can communicate?\\r\\n\\r\\nQualifications and requirements for a senior data scientist position.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresenting my work is one of the surprising challenges I faced in my recent\\r\\ntransition from academia to life as a data analyst at a market research and strategy firm . When I was a linguistics PhD student at UCLA studying learnability theory in\\r\\na classroom or measuring effects of an oral constriction on glottal vibration in\\r\\na sound booth, my colleagues and I were comfortable speaking the same language.\\r\\nNow that I work with a much more diverse crowd of co-workers and clients with\\r\\nvaried backgrounds and types of expertise, I need to work harder to ensure that\\r\\nthe insights of my analyses are communicated effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this second entry in the communicating data science series , I cover some essentials when it comes to presenting a thorough,\\r\\ncomprehensible analysis for readers who want (or need) to know how to get their\\r\\nwork noticed and read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nGET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME\\r\\nImagine you\\u2019ve just completed the so-called heavy lifting, whatever it may be,\\r\\nand you\\u2019re ready to present your results and conclusions in a report. Well, step\\r\\naway from the word processor! There are two things you must first consider: your\\r\\naudience and your goals. This is your forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHO IS YOUR AUDIENCE?\\r\\nThe matter of who you\\u2019re speaking to will influence every detail of how you\\r\\nchoose to present your analysis from whether you use technical jargon or spend\\r\\ntime carefully defining your terms. The formality of the context may determine\\r\\nwhether a short, fun tangent or personal anecdote will keep your audience\\r\\nhappily engaged or elicit eye rolls \\u2026 and worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is all important to consider because once you\\u2019ve envisioned your audience,\\r\\nyou take stock of what may and may not be shared knowledge and how to manage\\r\\ntheir expectations. In your writing (and in everyday life), it\\u2019s useful to be\\r\\ncognizant of Grice\\u2019s principles of cooperative communication:\\r\\n\\r\\n 1. Maxim of quantity : be informative, without giving overwhelming amounts of extraneous detail.\\r\\n 2. Maxim of quality : be truthful. Enough said.\\r\\n 3. Maxim of relation : be relevant. I\\u2019ll give you some tips on staying topical shortly!\\r\\n 4. Maxim of manner : be clear. Don\\u2019t be ambiguous, be orderly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo be cooperative! Know your audience and do what you can to anticipate their\\r\\nexpectations. This will ensure that you cover all ground in exactly as much\\r\\ndetail as necessary in your report.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT IS THE GOAL?\\r\\nAlso before you put pen to paper, it\\u2019s helpful remind yourself again (and again)\\r\\nof what your goal is. If you\\u2019re working in a professional environment, you\\u2019re\\r\\naware that it\\u2019s important to be continually mindful of the goal or business\\r\\nproblem and why you\\u2019re tasked with solving it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr perhaps it's a strategic initiative you're after: Did you set out to learn\\r\\nsomething new about some data (and the world)? Or have you been diligently\\r\\nworking on a new skill you\\u2019d like to showcase? Do you want to test out some\\r\\nideas and get feedback? It\\u2019s okay to make it your goal to find out \\u201cCan I do\\r\\nthis?\\u201d Maybe you want to share some of your expertise with the community on\\r\\nKaggle Scripts. In that case, it\\u2019s even more imperative that you have a\\r\\nbuttoned-up analysis!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"If we can really understand the problem, the answer will come out of it,\\r\\nbecause the answer is not separate from the problem.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2015 Jiddu KrishnamurtiIf you\\u2019ve reached the point of having an analysis to report, you\\u2019ve more than\\r\\nlikely familiarized yourself with the goals of the initiative, but you must also\\r\\nkeep them at the forefront of your thoughts when presenting your results as\\r\\nwell. Your work should be contextualized in terms of your understanding of the\\r\\nresearch objectives. Often in my own day job this means synthesizing many\\r\\nanalyses I\\u2019ve performed into a few key pieces of evidence which support a story;\\r\\nthis can\\u2019t be done well except by accident without keeping in mind the ultimate\\r\\nobjective at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PREAMBLE\\r\\nNow that you\\u2019ve got yourself in the right frame of mind\\u2015you can see the forest\\r\\nand you know the trees\\u2015you\\u2019re ready to start thinking about the content of your\\r\\nreport. However, before you start furiously spilling ink, first remind yourself\\r\\nof the three elements required to ask an askable question in science:\\r\\n\\r\\n 1. The question itself along with some justification of how it addresses your\\r\\n    objectives\\r\\n 2. A hypothesis\\r\\n 3. A feasible methodology for addressing your question\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch as I implore you to consider who your audience is and what your objectives\\r\\nare in order to get your mind in the right place, I\\u2019m recommending that you have\\r\\nthe answers to these three things ready because they will dictate the content of\\r\\nyour report. You don\\u2019t want to throw everything and the kitchen sink into a\\r\\nreport!\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S THE QUESTION?\\r\\nOn Kaggle, the competition hosts very generously provide their burning questions\\r\\nto the community. Outside of this environment, the challenge is to come up with\\r\\none on your own or work within the business objectives of your employer. At this\\r\\npoint, you make sure that you can appropriately state the question and how it\\r\\nrelates to your objective(s).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an aside, if you need some exercise in the area of asking insightful\\r\\nquestions (a skill unto its own), I hereby challenge you to scroll through some\\r\\nof Kagglers\\u2019 most recent scripts, find and read one, and think of one new\\r\\nquestion you could ask the author. If you find that this is a stumbling block\\r\\npreventing you from proceeding with your analysis, many dataset publishers\\r\\ninclude a number of questions they\\u2019d like to see addressed. Or read the Script of the Week blogs and see what other ideas script authors would like to see explored in the same\\r\\ndataset.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S THE ANSWER?\\r\\nNow that you have your question, what do you think the answer will be? It\\u2019s good\\r\\npractice, of course, to consider what the possible answers may be before you dig\\r\\ninto the data, so hopefully you\\u2019ve already done that! Clearly delimiting the\\r\\nhypothesis space at this point will guide the evidence and arguments you use in\\r\\nthe body of your report. It will be easier to evaluate what constitutes weak and\\r\\nstrong support of your theory and what analyses may be absolutely irrelevant.\\r\\nUltimately you will prevent yourself from attacking straw men in faux support of your theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon't build straw men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S YOUR METHODOLOGY?\\r\\nLet\\u2019s say you\\u2019re asking whether Twitter users with dense social networks in the How ISIS Uses Twitter dataset express greater negative sentiment than users with less dense networks. Your\\r\\nfirst step is to confirm that the data available is sufficient to address your\\r\\nresearch question. If there\\u2019s major missing information, you may want to rethink\\r\\nyour question, revise your methodology, or even collect new data.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\u2019re unsure of how to put language to a particular methodology, this is a\\r\\ngood opportunity to flex your Googling skills. Search for \\u201csocial network\\r\\nanalysis in r\\u201d or \\u201csentiment analysis in python.\\u201d Dive into some academic papers\\r\\nif it's appropriate and see how it's presented. Peruse the natural language processing tags on No Free Hunch and read the winners\\u2019 interviews . Get inspiration from scripts on similar datasets on Kaggle. For example, a similar analysis was performed by Kaggle user Khomutov Nikita using the Hillary Clinton\\u2019s Emails dataset .\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary Clinton's network graph. See the code here .\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if you don\\u2019t end up needing to share every nuance of your methodology with\\r\\nyour given audience, you should always document your work thoroughly to the\\r\\nextent possible. Once you\\u2019re ready to present your analysis, you\\u2019ll be capable\\r\\nof determining how much is the right amount to share when discussing the nitty\\r\\ngritty mechanics of your model. Similarly, I've been able to pleasantly surprise\\r\\nmy boss many times because I have an answer ready at-hand for immediate\\r\\nquestions thanks to keeping my exploratory analyses well-documented.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the way, if you\\u2019ve felt overwhelmed by the task of putting together a solid\\r\\nmethodology for tackling a question, it can\\u2019t hurt to lob an idea and some code\\r\\nto the community for feedback. Especially once you have solid presentation of\\r\\nanalysis skills! Be honest about where you feel you could use extra input and\\r\\nmaybe a fellow Kaggler will come forth with different angle on the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER\\r\\nFinally, you\\u2019re ready to write. Keep in mind that a good analysis should\\r\\nfacilitate its own interpretation as much as possible. Again, this requires\\r\\nanticipating what information your likely audience will be seeking and what\\r\\nknowledge they\\u2019re coming in with already. One method which is both\\r\\ntried-and-true and friendly to the academic nature of the discipline is\\r\\nfollowing a template for your analysis. With that, this section covers the\\r\\nstructure which when fleshed out will help you tell the story in the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep in mind that a good analysis should facilitate its own interpretation as\\r\\nmuch as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOT SO ABSTRACT\\r\\nMake it easy for your audience to quickly determine what they\\u2019re about to\\r\\ndigest. Use an abstract or introduction to recall your objectives and clearly\\r\\nstate them for your readers. What is the problem that you\\u2019ve set out to solve?\\r\\nIf you have a desired outcome or any expectations of your audience, say it, as\\r\\nthis is the entire reason you\\u2019re presenting them with your analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou then cover everything from your preamble in this section: the question\\r\\nyou\\u2019ve been on a mission to answer, your hypothesis, and the methodology you\\u2019ve\\r\\nused. Finally, you will often provide a high level summary of your results and\\r\\nkey findings. Don\\u2019t worry about spoiler alerts or boring your readers to death\\r\\nwith the content that\\u2019s about to follow. Trust that if they pay attention past\\r\\nthe introduction that they are interested in how you achieve what you claim you\\r\\nhave.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people I've talked to have said that they often find it easier to write the\\r\\nabstract after having already completely documented the detailed findings of the analysis. I\\r\\nthink that this is at least in part because you've familiarized yourself with\\r\\nyour own work through the lens of your readership by doing so. Slowly but surely\\r\\nyou're extracting yourself from the trees and the bigger picture becomes\\r\\napparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CONTENT: BREAK OFF WHAT YOU CAN CHEW\\r\\nThis is where the good stuff lives. You've laid the foundation for your analysis\\r\\nsuch that your audience is prepared to read or listen intently to your story. I\\r\\ncan\\u2019t tell you the specifics of what goes here, but I can tell you how to\\r\\nstructure it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake your analysis in small bits by breaking your question into subparts. For a\\r\\ndata-driven analysis, it can make sense to tackle each piece of evidence\\r\\none-by-one. You may have a dissertation\\u2019s worth of data to report on, but more\\r\\nlikely than not you must pick and choose what will best support your analysis\\r\\nsuccinctly and effectively. Again, having the objectives and audience in mind\\r\\nwill help you decide what\\u2019s critical. Lay it all out before you and pair\\r\\nsub-questions with evidence until you have a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you\\u2019ve presented the evidence, explain why it supports (or doesn't support)\\r\\nyour hypothesis or your objectives. A good analysis also considers alternative\\r\\nhypotheses or interpretations as well. You\\u2019ve already surveyed the hypothesis\\r\\nspace, so you should be ready-armed to handle contrary evidence. Doing so is\\r\\nalso a way of anticipating the expectations of your audience and the skepticism\\r\\nthey may harbor. It\\u2019s at this point that it\\u2019s most critical to keep in mind your\\r\\nobjectives and the question you\\u2019re addressing with your analysis. Ask how every\\r\\npiece of evidence you offer takes you one step closer to confirming or\\r\\ndisproving your hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER TIPS AND TRICKS\\r\\nVisualize the problem . Seeing is believing. It\\u2019s cliched to say in any statement asserting the value\\r\\nof data visualization, but it\\u2019s so incredibly true. This \\u201ctrick\\u201d is so effective\\r\\nthat I\\u2019m going to spend more time talking about it in a future post. If you can\\r\\nplainly \\u201cstate\\u201d something with a graph or chart, go for it!\\r\\n\\r\\n * Shail Jayesh Deliwala visualizes confusion matrices to evaluate and compare model performance.\\r\\n   Read the full notebook here .\\\" /\\r\\n * Lj Miranda shows the steady rise of carbon emissions in the Philippines.

Read the full notebook here .\\\" /\\r\\n\\r\\nVariety is the spice of life . And it can liven up your writing (and speaking) as well. For example, use a\\r\\nmix of short and sweet sentences interspersed among longer, more elaborate ones.\\r\\nFind where you accidentally used the word \\u201cdidactic\\u201d four times on one page and\\r\\nchange it up! Related to my first point, use effective variety in types of\\r\\nvisualizations you employ. Small things like this will keep your readers awake\\r\\nand interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheck your work . I don\\u2019t like to emphasize this too much because I\\u2019m a descriptivist , but make sure your writing is grammatical, fluent, and free of typos. For\\r\\nbetter or worse, trivial mistakes can discredit you in the eyes of many. I find\\r\\nthat it helps to read my writing aloud to catch disfluencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nGain muscle memory . If you really struggle with transforming your analysis into a form that can\\r\\nbe shared more broadly, begin by writing anything until writing prose feels as natural as writing code. For example, I actually\\r\\nsuggest sitting down and copying a report word-for-word. Or even any instance of\\r\\npersuasive writing. Not to be used as your own in any way (i.e., plagiarism),\\r\\nbut to remove one more unknown from the equation: what it literally feels like to go through the motions of stringing words and sentences and paragraphs\\r\\ntogether to tell a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCLUSIONS & NEXT STEPS\\r\\nA good analysis is repetitive. You know the intricacies of your work in and out,\\r\\nbut your audience does not. You\\u2019ve told your readers in your abstract (or\\r\\nintroduction, if you prefer) what you had ventured to do and even what you end\\r\\nup finding and the content lays this all out for them. In the conclusions\\r\\nsection you hit them with it again. At this point, they\\u2019ve seen the relevant\\r\\ndata you\\u2019ve carefully chosen to support your theory so it\\u2019s time to formally\\r\\ndraw your conclusions. Your readers can decide if they agree or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of being repetitive, after making your conclusions, you again remind\\r\\nyour readers of the objective(s) of this report. Restate them again and help\\r\\nyour readers help you\\u2015what do you expect now? What feedback would you like? What\\r\\ndecision-making can happen now that your report is presented and the insights\\r\\nhave been shared? In my work, I often collaborate with strategists to develop a\\r\\nset of recommendations for our clients. Typically I'll take a stab at it based\\r\\non the expertise I've gained in working with the data and a strategist will\\r\\nrefine using their business insights.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIN\\r\\nAnd this is exactly where the beauty of the analysis and your skillful\\r\\npresentation thereof meet. Because you\\u2019ve managed to package your approach in a\\r\\nfashion digestible to your audience, your readers, collaborators, and clients\\r\\nhave comprehended and learned from your analysis and what its implications are\\r\\nwithout getting lost in the trees. They are equipped to react to the value in\\r\\nyour work and participate in the next step of realizing its objectives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for reading the second entry in this series on communicating data science . I covered the basics of presenting an analysis at a very high level. I'd love\\r\\nto learn what your approach is, how you realize the value in your work, and how\\r\\nyou collaborate with others to achieve business goals.

Trying to summarize it ended up being quite long\\r\\n   anyway. A lot of distilled information.\\r\\n   \\r\\n   We work a bit differently. We include an executive summary + recommendations\\r\\n   at the beginning of the presentation instead of putting them at the end, just\\r\\n   after stating the question to answer. After that the audience knows what will\\r\\n   come, and when the presentation is revisited it is a lot faster to check . If\\r\\n   there's a need to dig deeper, there's always available all the analysis\\r\\n   steps.\\r\\n   \\r\\n   Hoping to see the next one soon! \\ud83d\\ude00\\r\\n   \\r\\n    * Megan RisdalThanks! I actually often do the same thing re: executive summaries in my\\r\\n      day job, too! That's a really good point. There's definitely no\\r\\n      one-size-fits-all approach which makes a high-level summarization\\r\\n      misleading in certain ways. And now that I think of it, another strength\\r\\n      in communicating data science is being able to be information dense &\\r\\n      concise for times where you need to fit your work into a standalone one-\\r\\n      or two-sheeter/executive summary.\\r\\n      \\r\\n      Hopefully more good stuff coming soon. \\ud83d\\ude42\\r\\n      \\r\\n      \\r\\n    * \\r\\n   \\r\\n   \\r\\n * \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OFFICIAL BLOG OF KAGGLE.COM\\r\\nSearchCATEGORIES\\r\\n * Data Science News (38)\\r\\n * Kaggle News (120)\\r\\n * Kernels (22)\\r\\n * Tutorials (28)\\r\\n * Winners' Interviews (174)\\r\\n\\r\\nWANT TO SUBSCRIBE?\\r\\nEmail Address * First Name * = required fieldPOPULAR TAGS\\r\\nAlgo Trading Challenge Annual Santa Competition binary classification community computer vision CrowdFlower Search Results Relevance Dark Matter Deloitte diabetes Diabetic Retinopathy EEG data Elo Chess Ratings Competition Eurovision Challenge Facebook Recruiting Flavours of Physics: Finding \\u03c4 \\u2192 \\u03bc\\u03bc\\u03bc Flight Quest Grasp-and-Lift EEG Detection Heritage Health Prize How Much Did It Rain? image classification Intel Kaggle InClass Kernels logistic regression March Mania Merck multiclass classification natural language processing optimization problem Otto Product Classification Owen Zhang Practice Fusion Product Product News Profiling Top Kagglers Recruiting regression problem scikit-learn scripts of the week The Hunt for Prohibited Content Tourism Forecasting Tutorial video series Wikipedia Challenge XGBoostARCHIVES\\r\\nArchives Select Month July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 Toggle the Widgetbar\",\n          \"Skip navigation Sign in SearchLoading...\\r\\n\\r\\nClose Yeah, keep it Undo CloseTHIS VIDEO IS UNAVAILABLE.\\r\\nWATCH QUEUE\\r\\nQUEUE\\r\\nWatch Queue Queue * Remove all\\r\\n * Disconnect\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next video is starting stop 1.

Here lies the challenge in both performing and presenting an analysis. As\\r\\ndata scientists, analysts, and machine learning engineers faced with fulfilling\\r\\nbusiness objectives, we find ourselves bridging the gap between The Two Cultures : sciences and humanities. After spending countless hours at the terminal\\r\\ndevising a creative and elegant solution to a difficult problem, the insights\\r\\nand business applications are obvious in our minds. But how do you distill them\\r\\ninto something you can communicate?\\r\\n\\r\\nQualifications and requirements for a senior data scientist position.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresenting my work is one of the surprising challenges I faced in my recent\\r\\ntransition from academia to life as a data analyst at a market research and strategy firm . When I was a linguistics PhD student at UCLA studying learnability theory in\\r\\na classroom or measuring effects of an oral constriction on glottal vibration in\\r\\na sound booth, my colleagues and I were comfortable speaking the same language.\\r\\nNow that I work with a much more diverse crowd of co-workers and clients with\\r\\nvaried backgrounds and types of expertise, I need to work harder to ensure that\\r\\nthe insights of my analyses are communicated effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this second entry in the communicating data science series , I cover some essentials when it comes to presenting a thorough,\\r\\ncomprehensible analysis for readers who want (or need) to know how to get their\\r\\nwork noticed and read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nGET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME\\r\\nImagine you\\u2019ve just completed the so-called heavy lifting, whatever it may be,\\r\\nand you\\u2019re ready to present your results and conclusions in a report. Well, step\\r\\naway from the word processor! There are two things you must first consider: your\\r\\naudience and your goals. This is your forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHO IS YOUR AUDIENCE?\\r\\nThe matter of who you\\u2019re speaking to will influence every detail of how you\\r\\nchoose to present your analysis from whether you use technical jargon or spend\\r\\ntime carefully defining your terms. The formality of the context may determine\\r\\nwhether a short, fun tangent or personal anecdote will keep your audience\\r\\nhappily engaged or elicit eye rolls \\u2026 and worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is all important to consider because once you\\u2019ve envisioned your audience,\\r\\nyou take stock of what may and may not be shared knowledge and how to manage\\r\\ntheir expectations. In your writing (and in everyday life), it\\u2019s useful to be\\r\\ncognizant of Grice\\u2019s principles of cooperative communication:\\r\\n\\r\\n 1. Maxim of quantity : be informative, without giving overwhelming amounts of extraneous detail.\\r\\n 2. Maxim of quality : be truthful. Enough said.\\r\\n 3. Maxim of relation : be relevant. I\\u2019ll give you some tips on staying topical shortly!\\r\\n 4. Maxim of manner : be clear. Don\\u2019t be ambiguous, be orderly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo be cooperative! Know your audience and do what you can to anticipate their\\r\\nexpectations. This will ensure that you cover all ground in exactly as much\\r\\ndetail as necessary in your report.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT IS THE GOAL?\\r\\nAlso before you put pen to paper, it\\u2019s helpful remind yourself again (and again)\\r\\nof what your goal is. If you\\u2019re working in a professional environment, you\\u2019re\\r\\naware that it\\u2019s important to be continually mindful of the goal or business\\r\\nproblem and why you\\u2019re tasked with solving it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr perhaps it's a strategic initiative you're after: Did you set out to learn\\r\\nsomething new about some data (and the world)? Or have you been diligently\\r\\nworking on a new skill you\\u2019d like to showcase? Do you want to test out some\\r\\nideas and get feedback? It\\u2019s okay to make it your goal to find out \\u201cCan I do\\r\\nthis?\\u201d Maybe you want to share some of your expertise with the community on\\r\\nKaggle Scripts. In that case, it\\u2019s even more imperative that you have a\\r\\nbuttoned-up analysis!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"If we can really understand the problem, the answer will come out of it,\\r\\nbecause the answer is not separate from the problem.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2015 Jiddu KrishnamurtiIf you\\u2019ve reached the point of having an analysis to report, you\\u2019ve more than\\r\\nlikely familiarized yourself with the goals of the initiative, but you must also\\r\\nkeep them at the forefront of your thoughts when presenting your results as\\r\\nwell. Your work should be contextualized in terms of your understanding of the\\r\\nresearch objectives. Often in my own day job this means synthesizing many\\r\\nanalyses I\\u2019ve performed into a few key pieces of evidence which support a story;\\r\\nthis can\\u2019t be done well except by accident without keeping in mind the ultimate\\r\\nobjective at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PREAMBLE\\r\\nNow that you\\u2019ve got yourself in the right frame of mind\\u2015you can see the forest\\r\\nand you know the trees\\u2015you\\u2019re ready to start thinking about the content of your\\r\\nreport. However, before you start furiously spilling ink, first remind yourself\\r\\nof the three elements required to ask an askable question in science:\\r\\n\\r\\n 1. The question itself along with some justification of how it addresses your\\r\\n    objectives\\r\\n 2. A hypothesis\\r\\n 3. A feasible methodology for addressing your question\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch as I implore you to consider who your audience is and what your objectives\\r\\nare in order to get your mind in the right place, I\\u2019m recommending that you have\\r\\nthe answers to these three things ready because they will dictate the content of\\r\\nyour report. You don\\u2019t want to throw everything and the kitchen sink into a\\r\\nreport!\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S THE QUESTION?\\r\\nOn Kaggle, the competition hosts very generously provide their burning questions\\r\\nto the community. Outside of this environment, the challenge is to come up with\\r\\none on your own or work within the business objectives of your employer. At this\\r\\npoint, you make sure that you can appropriately state the question and how it\\r\\nrelates to your objective(s).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an aside, if you need some exercise in the area of asking insightful\\r\\nquestions (a skill unto its own), I hereby challenge you to scroll through some\\r\\nof Kagglers\\u2019 most recent scripts, find and read one, and think of one new\\r\\nquestion you could ask the author. If you find that this is a stumbling block\\r\\npreventing you from proceeding with your analysis, many dataset publishers\\r\\ninclude a number of questions they\\u2019d like to see addressed. Or read the Script of the Week blogs and see what other ideas script authors would like to see explored in the same\\r\\ndataset.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S THE ANSWER?\\r\\nNow that you have your question, what do you think the answer will be? It\\u2019s good\\r\\npractice, of course, to consider what the possible answers may be before you dig\\r\\ninto the data, so hopefully you\\u2019ve already done that! Clearly delimiting the\\r\\nhypothesis space at this point will guide the evidence and arguments you use in\\r\\nthe body of your report. It will be easier to evaluate what constitutes weak and\\r\\nstrong support of your theory and what analyses may be absolutely irrelevant.\\r\\nUltimately you will prevent yourself from attacking straw men in faux support of your theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon't build straw men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S YOUR METHODOLOGY?\\r\\nLet\\u2019s say you\\u2019re asking whether Twitter users with dense social networks in the How ISIS Uses Twitter dataset express greater negative sentiment than users with less dense networks. Your\\r\\nfirst step is to confirm that the data available is sufficient to address your\\r\\nresearch question. If there\\u2019s major missing information, you may want to rethink\\r\\nyour question, revise your methodology, or even collect new data.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\u2019re unsure of how to put language to a particular methodology, this is a\\r\\ngood opportunity to flex your Googling skills. Search for \\u201csocial network\\r\\nanalysis in r\\u201d or \\u201csentiment analysis in python.\\u201d Dive into some academic papers\\r\\nif it's appropriate and see how it's presented. Peruse the natural language processing tags on No Free Hunch and read the winners\\u2019 interviews . Get inspiration from scripts on similar datasets on Kaggle. For example, a similar analysis was performed by Kaggle user Khomutov Nikita using the Hillary Clinton\\u2019s Emails dataset .\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary Clinton's network graph. See the code here .\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if you don\\u2019t end up needing to share every nuance of your methodology with\\r\\nyour given audience, you should always document your work thoroughly to the\\r\\nextent possible. Once you\\u2019re ready to present your analysis, you\\u2019ll be capable\\r\\nof determining how much is the right amount to share when discussing the nitty\\r\\ngritty mechanics of your model. Similarly, I've been able to pleasantly surprise\\r\\nmy boss many times because I have an answer ready at-hand for immediate\\r\\nquestions thanks to keeping my exploratory analyses well-documented.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the way, if you\\u2019ve felt overwhelmed by the task of putting together a solid\\r\\nmethodology for tackling a question, it can\\u2019t hurt to lob an idea and some code\\r\\nto the community for feedback. Especially once you have solid presentation of\\r\\nanalysis skills! Be honest about where you feel you could use extra input and\\r\\nmaybe a fellow Kaggler will come forth with different angle on the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER\\r\\nFinally, you\\u2019re ready to write. Keep in mind that a good analysis should\\r\\nfacilitate its own interpretation as much as possible. Again, this requires\\r\\nanticipating what information your likely audience will be seeking and what\\r\\nknowledge they\\u2019re coming in with already. One method which is both\\r\\ntried-and-true and friendly to the academic nature of the discipline is\\r\\nfollowing a template for your analysis. With that, this section covers the\\r\\nstructure which when fleshed out will help you tell the story in the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep in mind that a good analysis should facilitate its own interpretation as\\r\\nmuch as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOT SO ABSTRACT\\r\\nMake it easy for your audience to quickly determine what they\\u2019re about to\\r\\ndigest. Use an abstract or introduction to recall your objectives and clearly\\r\\nstate them for your readers. What is the problem that you\\u2019ve set out to solve?\\r\\nIf you have a desired outcome or any expectations of your audience, say it, as\\r\\nthis is the entire reason you\\u2019re presenting them with your analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou then cover everything from your preamble in this section: the question\\r\\nyou\\u2019ve been on a mission to answer, your hypothesis, and the methodology you\\u2019ve\\r\\nused. Finally, you will often provide a high level summary of your results and\\r\\nkey findings. Don\\u2019t worry about spoiler alerts or boring your readers to death\\r\\nwith the content that\\u2019s about to follow. Trust that if they pay attention past\\r\\nthe introduction that they are interested in how you achieve what you claim you\\r\\nhave.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people I've talked to have said that they often find it easier to write the\\r\\nabstract after having already completely documented the detailed findings of the analysis. I\\r\\nthink that this is at least in part because you've familiarized yourself with\\r\\nyour own work through the lens of your readership by doing so. Slowly but surely\\r\\nyou're extracting yourself from the trees and the bigger picture becomes\\r\\napparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CONTENT: BREAK OFF WHAT YOU CAN CHEW\\r\\nThis is where the good stuff lives. You've laid the foundation for your analysis\\r\\nsuch that your audience is prepared to read or listen intently to your story. I\\r\\ncan\\u2019t tell you the specifics of what goes here, but I can tell you how to\\r\\nstructure it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake your analysis in small bits by breaking your question into subparts. For a\\r\\ndata-driven analysis, it can make sense to tackle each piece of evidence\\r\\none-by-one. You may have a dissertation\\u2019s worth of data to report on, but more\\r\\nlikely than not you must pick and choose what will best support your analysis\\r\\nsuccinctly and effectively. Again, having the objectives and audience in mind\\r\\nwill help you decide what\\u2019s critical. Lay it all out before you and pair\\r\\nsub-questions with evidence until you have a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you\\u2019ve presented the evidence, explain why it supports (or doesn't support)\\r\\nyour hypothesis or your objectives. A good analysis also considers alternative\\r\\nhypotheses or interpretations as well. You\\u2019ve already surveyed the hypothesis\\r\\nspace, so you should be ready-armed to handle contrary evidence. Doing so is\\r\\nalso a way of anticipating the expectations of your audience and the skepticism\\r\\nthey may harbor. It\\u2019s at this point that it\\u2019s most critical to keep in mind your\\r\\nobjectives and the question you\\u2019re addressing with your analysis. Ask how every\\r\\npiece of evidence you offer takes you one step closer to confirming or\\r\\ndisproving your hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER TIPS AND TRICKS\\r\\nVisualize the problem . Seeing is believing. It\\u2019s cliched to say in any statement asserting the value\\r\\nof data visualization, but it\\u2019s so incredibly true. This \\u201ctrick\\u201d is so effective\\r\\nthat I\\u2019m going to spend more time talking about it in a future post. If you can\\r\\nplainly \\u201cstate\\u201d something with a graph or chart, go for it!\\r\\n\\r\\n * Shail Jayesh Deliwala visualizes confusion matrices to evaluate and compare model performance.\\r\\n   Read the full notebook here .\\\" /\\r\\n * Lj Miranda shows the steady rise of carbon emissions in the Philippines.

Read the full notebook here .\\\" /\\r\\n\\r\\nVariety is the spice of life . And it can liven up your writing (and speaking) as well. For example, use a\\r\\nmix of short and sweet sentences interspersed among longer, more elaborate ones.\\r\\nFind where you accidentally used the word \\u201cdidactic\\u201d four times on one page and\\r\\nchange it up! Related to my first point, use effective variety in types of\\r\\nvisualizations you employ. Small things like this will keep your readers awake\\r\\nand interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheck your work . I don\\u2019t like to emphasize this too much because I\\u2019m a descriptivist , but make sure your writing is grammatical, fluent, and free of typos. For\\r\\nbetter or worse, trivial mistakes can discredit you in the eyes of many. I find\\r\\nthat it helps to read my writing aloud to catch disfluencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nGain muscle memory . If you really struggle with transforming your analysis into a form that can\\r\\nbe shared more broadly, begin by writing anything until writing prose feels as natural as writing code. For example, I actually\\r\\nsuggest sitting down and copying a report word-for-word. Or even any instance of\\r\\npersuasive writing. Not to be used as your own in any way (i.e., plagiarism),\\r\\nbut to remove one more unknown from the equation: what it literally feels like to go through the motions of stringing words and sentences and paragraphs\\r\\ntogether to tell a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCLUSIONS & NEXT STEPS\\r\\nA good analysis is repetitive. You know the intricacies of your work in and out,\\r\\nbut your audience does not. You\\u2019ve told your readers in your abstract (or\\r\\nintroduction, if you prefer) what you had ventured to do and even what you end\\r\\nup finding and the content lays this all out for them. In the conclusions\\r\\nsection you hit them with it again. At this point, they\\u2019ve seen the relevant\\r\\ndata you\\u2019ve carefully chosen to support your theory so it\\u2019s time to formally\\r\\ndraw your conclusions. Your readers can decide if they agree or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of being repetitive, after making your conclusions, you again remind\\r\\nyour readers of the objective(s) of this report. Restate them again and help\\r\\nyour readers help you\\u2015what do you expect now? What feedback would you like? What\\r\\ndecision-making can happen now that your report is presented and the insights\\r\\nhave been shared? In my work, I often collaborate with strategists to develop a\\r\\nset of recommendations for our clients. Typically I'll take a stab at it based\\r\\non the expertise I've gained in working with the data and a strategist will\\r\\nrefine using their business insights.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIN\\r\\nAnd this is exactly where the beauty of the analysis and your skillful\\r\\npresentation thereof meet. Because you\\u2019ve managed to package your approach in a\\r\\nfashion digestible to your audience, your readers, collaborators, and clients\\r\\nhave comprehended and learned from your analysis and what its implications are\\r\\nwithout getting lost in the trees. They are equipped to react to the value in\\r\\nyour work and participate in the next step of realizing its objectives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for reading the second entry in this series on communicating data science . I covered the basics of presenting an analysis at a very high level. I'd love\\r\\nto learn what your approach is, how you realize the value in your work, and how\\r\\nyou collaborate with others to achieve business goals.

Trying to summarize it ended up being quite long\\r\\n   anyway. A lot of distilled information.\\r\\n   \\r\\n   We work a bit differently. We include an executive summary + recommendations\\r\\n   at the beginning of the presentation instead of putting them at the end, just\\r\\n   after stating the question to answer. After that the audience knows what will\\r\\n   come, and when the presentation is revisited it is a lot faster to check . If\\r\\n   there's a need to dig deeper, there's always available all the analysis\\r\\n   steps.\\r\\n   \\r\\n   Hoping to see the next one soon! \\ud83d\\ude00\\r\\n   \\r\\n    * Megan RisdalThanks! I actually often do the same thing re: executive summaries in my\\r\\n      day job, too! That's a really good point. There's definitely no\\r\\n      one-size-fits-all approach which makes a high-level summarization\\r\\n      misleading in certain ways. And now that I think of it, another strength\\r\\n      in communicating data science is being able to be information dense &\\r\\n      concise for times where you need to fit your work into a standalone one-\\r\\n      or two-sheeter/executive summary.\\r\\n      \\r\\n      Hopefully more good stuff coming soon. \\ud83d\\ude42\\r\\n      \\r\\n      \\r\\n    * \\r\\n   \\r\\n   \\r\\n * \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OFFICIAL BLOG OF KAGGLE.COM\\r\\nSearchCATEGORIES\\r\\n * Data Science News (38)\\r\\n * Kaggle News (120)\\r\\n * Kernels (22)\\r\\n * Tutorials (28)\\r\\n * Winners' Interviews (174)\\r\\n\\r\\nWANT TO SUBSCRIBE?\\r\\nEmail Address * First Name * = required fieldPOPULAR TAGS\\r\\nAlgo Trading Challenge Annual Santa Competition binary classification community computer vision CrowdFlower Search Results Relevance Dark Matter Deloitte diabetes Diabetic Retinopathy EEG data Elo Chess Ratings Competition Eurovision Challenge Facebook Recruiting Flavours of Physics: Finding \\u03c4 \\u2192 \\u03bc\\u03bc\\u03bc Flight Quest Grasp-and-Lift EEG Detection Heritage Health Prize How Much Did It Rain? image classification Intel Kaggle InClass Kernels logistic regression March Mania Merck multiclass classification natural language processing optimization problem Otto Product Classification Owen Zhang Practice Fusion Product Product News Profiling Top Kagglers Recruiting regression problem scikit-learn scripts of the week The Hunt for Prohibited Content Tourism Forecasting Tutorial video series Wikipedia Challenge XGBoostARCHIVES\\r\\nArchives Select Month July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 Toggle the Widgetbar\",\n          \"Skip navigation Sign in SearchLoading...\\r\\n\\r\\nClose Yeah, keep it Undo CloseTHIS VIDEO IS UNAVAILABLE.\\r\\nWATCH QUEUE\\r\\nQUEUE\\r\\nWatch Queue Queue * Remove all\\r\\n * Disconnect\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next video is starting stop 1.

Here lies the challenge in both performing and presenting an analysis. As\\r\\ndata scientists, analysts, and machine learning engineers faced with fulfilling\\r\\nbusiness objectives, we find ourselves bridging the gap between The Two Cultures : sciences and humanities. After spending countless hours at the terminal\\r\\ndevising a creative and elegant solution to a difficult problem, the insights\\r\\nand business applications are obvious in our minds. But how do you distill them\\r\\ninto something you can communicate?\\r\\n\\r\\nQualifications and requirements for a senior data scientist position.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresenting my work is one of the surprising challenges I faced in my recent\\r\\ntransition from academia to life as a data analyst at a market research and strategy firm . When I was a linguistics PhD student at UCLA studying learnability theory in\\r\\na classroom or measuring effects of an oral constriction on glottal vibration in\\r\\na sound booth, my colleagues and I were comfortable speaking the same language.\\r\\nNow that I work with a much more diverse crowd of co-workers and clients with\\r\\nvaried backgrounds and types of expertise, I need to work harder to ensure that\\r\\nthe insights of my analyses are communicated effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this second entry in the communicating data science series , I cover some essentials when it comes to presenting a thorough,\\r\\ncomprehensible analysis for readers who want (or need) to know how to get their\\r\\nwork noticed and read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nGET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME\\r\\nImagine you\\u2019ve just completed the so-called heavy lifting, whatever it may be,\\r\\nand you\\u2019re ready to present your results and conclusions in a report. Well, step\\r\\naway from the word processor! There are two things you must first consider: your\\r\\naudience and your goals. This is your forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHO IS YOUR AUDIENCE?\\r\\nThe matter of who you\\u2019re speaking to will influence every detail of how you\\r\\nchoose to present your analysis from whether you use technical jargon or spend\\r\\ntime carefully defining your terms. The formality of the context may determine\\r\\nwhether a short, fun tangent or personal anecdote will keep your audience\\r\\nhappily engaged or elicit eye rolls \\u2026 and worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is all important to consider because once you\\u2019ve envisioned your audience,\\r\\nyou take stock of what may and may not be shared knowledge and how to manage\\r\\ntheir expectations. In your writing (and in everyday life), it\\u2019s useful to be\\r\\ncognizant of Grice\\u2019s principles of cooperative communication:\\r\\n\\r\\n 1. Maxim of quantity : be informative, without giving overwhelming amounts of extraneous detail.\\r\\n 2. Maxim of quality : be truthful. Enough said.\\r\\n 3. Maxim of relation : be relevant. I\\u2019ll give you some tips on staying topical shortly!\\r\\n 4. Maxim of manner : be clear. Don\\u2019t be ambiguous, be orderly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo be cooperative! Know your audience and do what you can to anticipate their\\r\\nexpectations. This will ensure that you cover all ground in exactly as much\\r\\ndetail as necessary in your report.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT IS THE GOAL?\\r\\nAlso before you put pen to paper, it\\u2019s helpful remind yourself again (and again)\\r\\nof what your goal is. If you\\u2019re working in a professional environment, you\\u2019re\\r\\naware that it\\u2019s important to be continually mindful of the goal or business\\r\\nproblem and why you\\u2019re tasked with solving it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr perhaps it's a strategic initiative you're after: Did you set out to learn\\r\\nsomething new about some data (and the world)? Or have you been diligently\\r\\nworking on a new skill you\\u2019d like to showcase? Do you want to test out some\\r\\nideas and get feedback? It\\u2019s okay to make it your goal to find out \\u201cCan I do\\r\\nthis?\\u201d Maybe you want to share some of your expertise with the community on\\r\\nKaggle Scripts. In that case, it\\u2019s even more imperative that you have a\\r\\nbuttoned-up analysis!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"If we can really understand the problem, the answer will come out of it,\\r\\nbecause the answer is not separate from the problem.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2015 Jiddu KrishnamurtiIf you\\u2019ve reached the point of having an analysis to report, you\\u2019ve more than\\r\\nlikely familiarized yourself with the goals of the initiative, but you must also\\r\\nkeep them at the forefront of your thoughts when presenting your results as\\r\\nwell. Your work should be contextualized in terms of your understanding of the\\r\\nresearch objectives. Often in my own day job this means synthesizing many\\r\\nanalyses I\\u2019ve performed into a few key pieces of evidence which support a story;\\r\\nthis can\\u2019t be done well except by accident without keeping in mind the ultimate\\r\\nobjective at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PREAMBLE\\r\\nNow that you\\u2019ve got yourself in the right frame of mind\\u2015you can see the forest\\r\\nand you know the trees\\u2015you\\u2019re ready to start thinking about the content of your\\r\\nreport. However, before you start furiously spilling ink, first remind yourself\\r\\nof the three elements required to ask an askable question in science:\\r\\n\\r\\n 1. The question itself along with some justification of how it addresses your\\r\\n    objectives\\r\\n 2. A hypothesis\\r\\n 3. A feasible methodology for addressing your question\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch as I implore you to consider who your audience is and what your objectives\\r\\nare in order to get your mind in the right place, I\\u2019m recommending that you have\\r\\nthe answers to these three things ready because they will dictate the content of\\r\\nyour report. You don\\u2019t want to throw everything and the kitchen sink into a\\r\\nreport!\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S THE QUESTION?\\r\\nOn Kaggle, the competition hosts very generously provide their burning questions\\r\\nto the community. Outside of this environment, the challenge is to come up with\\r\\none on your own or work within the business objectives of your employer. At this\\r\\npoint, you make sure that you can appropriately state the question and how it\\r\\nrelates to your objective(s).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an aside, if you need some exercise in the area of asking insightful\\r\\nquestions (a skill unto its own), I hereby challenge you to scroll through some\\r\\nof Kagglers\\u2019 most recent scripts, find and read one, and think of one new\\r\\nquestion you could ask the author. If you find that this is a stumbling block\\r\\npreventing you from proceeding with your analysis, many dataset publishers\\r\\ninclude a number of questions they\\u2019d like to see addressed. Or read the Script of the Week blogs and see what other ideas script authors would like to see explored in the same\\r\\ndataset.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S THE ANSWER?\\r\\nNow that you have your question, what do you think the answer will be? It\\u2019s good\\r\\npractice, of course, to consider what the possible answers may be before you dig\\r\\ninto the data, so hopefully you\\u2019ve already done that! Clearly delimiting the\\r\\nhypothesis space at this point will guide the evidence and arguments you use in\\r\\nthe body of your report. It will be easier to evaluate what constitutes weak and\\r\\nstrong support of your theory and what analyses may be absolutely irrelevant.\\r\\nUltimately you will prevent yourself from attacking straw men in faux support of your theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon't build straw men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\u2019S YOUR METHODOLOGY?\\r\\nLet\\u2019s say you\\u2019re asking whether Twitter users with dense social networks in the How ISIS Uses Twitter dataset express greater negative sentiment than users with less dense networks. Your\\r\\nfirst step is to confirm that the data available is sufficient to address your\\r\\nresearch question. If there\\u2019s major missing information, you may want to rethink\\r\\nyour question, revise your methodology, or even collect new data.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\u2019re unsure of how to put language to a particular methodology, this is a\\r\\ngood opportunity to flex your Googling skills. Search for \\u201csocial network\\r\\nanalysis in r\\u201d or \\u201csentiment analysis in python.\\u201d Dive into some academic papers\\r\\nif it's appropriate and see how it's presented. Peruse the natural language processing tags on No Free Hunch and read the winners\\u2019 interviews . Get inspiration from scripts on similar datasets on Kaggle. For example, a similar analysis was performed by Kaggle user Khomutov Nikita using the Hillary Clinton\\u2019s Emails dataset .\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary Clinton's network graph. See the code here .\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if you don\\u2019t end up needing to share every nuance of your methodology with\\r\\nyour given audience, you should always document your work thoroughly to the\\r\\nextent possible. Once you\\u2019re ready to present your analysis, you\\u2019ll be capable\\r\\nof determining how much is the right amount to share when discussing the nitty\\r\\ngritty mechanics of your model. Similarly, I've been able to pleasantly surprise\\r\\nmy boss many times because I have an answer ready at-hand for immediate\\r\\nquestions thanks to keeping my exploratory analyses well-documented.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the way, if you\\u2019ve felt overwhelmed by the task of putting together a solid\\r\\nmethodology for tackling a question, it can\\u2019t hurt to lob an idea and some code\\r\\nto the community for feedback. Especially once you have solid presentation of\\r\\nanalysis skills! Be honest about where you feel you could use extra input and\\r\\nmaybe a fellow Kaggler will come forth with different angle on the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER\\r\\nFinally, you\\u2019re ready to write. Keep in mind that a good analysis should\\r\\nfacilitate its own interpretation as much as possible. Again, this requires\\r\\nanticipating what information your likely audience will be seeking and what\\r\\nknowledge they\\u2019re coming in with already. One method which is both\\r\\ntried-and-true and friendly to the academic nature of the discipline is\\r\\nfollowing a template for your analysis. With that, this section covers the\\r\\nstructure which when fleshed out will help you tell the story in the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep in mind that a good analysis should facilitate its own interpretation as\\r\\nmuch as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOT SO ABSTRACT\\r\\nMake it easy for your audience to quickly determine what they\\u2019re about to\\r\\ndigest. Use an abstract or introduction to recall your objectives and clearly\\r\\nstate them for your readers. What is the problem that you\\u2019ve set out to solve?\\r\\nIf you have a desired outcome or any expectations of your audience, say it, as\\r\\nthis is the entire reason you\\u2019re presenting them with your analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou then cover everything from your preamble in this section: the question\\r\\nyou\\u2019ve been on a mission to answer, your hypothesis, and the methodology you\\u2019ve\\r\\nused. Finally, you will often provide a high level summary of your results and\\r\\nkey findings. Don\\u2019t worry about spoiler alerts or boring your readers to death\\r\\nwith the content that\\u2019s about to follow. Trust that if they pay attention past\\r\\nthe introduction that they are interested in how you achieve what you claim you\\r\\nhave.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people I've talked to have said that they often find it easier to write the\\r\\nabstract after having already completely documented the detailed findings of the analysis. I\\r\\nthink that this is at least in part because you've familiarized yourself with\\r\\nyour own work through the lens of your readership by doing so. Slowly but surely\\r\\nyou're extracting yourself from the trees and the bigger picture becomes\\r\\napparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CONTENT: BREAK OFF WHAT YOU CAN CHEW\\r\\nThis is where the good stuff lives. You've laid the foundation for your analysis\\r\\nsuch that your audience is prepared to read or listen intently to your story. I\\r\\ncan\\u2019t tell you the specifics of what goes here, but I can tell you how to\\r\\nstructure it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake your analysis in small bits by breaking your question into subparts. For a\\r\\ndata-driven analysis, it can make sense to tackle each piece of evidence\\r\\none-by-one. You may have a dissertation\\u2019s worth of data to report on, but more\\r\\nlikely than not you must pick and choose what will best support your analysis\\r\\nsuccinctly and effectively. Again, having the objectives and audience in mind\\r\\nwill help you decide what\\u2019s critical. Lay it all out before you and pair\\r\\nsub-questions with evidence until you have a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you\\u2019ve presented the evidence, explain why it supports (or doesn't support)\\r\\nyour hypothesis or your objectives. A good analysis also considers alternative\\r\\nhypotheses or interpretations as well. You\\u2019ve already surveyed the hypothesis\\r\\nspace, so you should be ready-armed to handle contrary evidence. Doing so is\\r\\nalso a way of anticipating the expectations of your audience and the skepticism\\r\\nthey may harbor. It\\u2019s at this point that it\\u2019s most critical to keep in mind your\\r\\nobjectives and the question you\\u2019re addressing with your analysis. Ask how every\\r\\npiece of evidence you offer takes you one step closer to confirming or\\r\\ndisproving your hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER TIPS AND TRICKS\\r\\nVisualize the problem . Seeing is believing. It\\u2019s cliched to say in any statement asserting the value\\r\\nof data visualization, but it\\u2019s so incredibly true. This \\u201ctrick\\u201d is so effective\\r\\nthat I\\u2019m going to spend more time talking about it in a future post. If you can\\r\\nplainly \\u201cstate\\u201d something with a graph or chart, go for it!\\r\\n\\r\\n * Shail Jayesh Deliwala visualizes confusion matrices to evaluate and compare model performance.\\r\\n   Read the full notebook here .\\\" /\\r\\n * Lj Miranda shows the steady rise of carbon emissions in the Philippines.

Read the full notebook here .\\\" /\\r\\n\\r\\nVariety is the spice of life . And it can liven up your writing (and speaking) as well. For example, use a\\r\\nmix of short and sweet sentences interspersed among longer, more elaborate ones.\\r\\nFind where you accidentally used the word \\u201cdidactic\\u201d four times on one page and\\r\\nchange it up! Related to my first point, use effective variety in types of\\r\\nvisualizations you employ. Small things like this will keep your readers awake\\r\\nand interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheck your work . I don\\u2019t like to emphasize this too much because I\\u2019m a descriptivist , but make sure your writing is grammatical, fluent, and free of typos. For\\r\\nbetter or worse, trivial mistakes can discredit you in the eyes of many. I find\\r\\nthat it helps to read my writing aloud to catch disfluencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nGain muscle memory . If you really struggle with transforming your analysis into a form that can\\r\\nbe shared more broadly, begin by writing anything until writing prose feels as natural as writing code. For example, I actually\\r\\nsuggest sitting down and copying a report word-for-word. Or even any instance of\\r\\npersuasive writing. Not to be used as your own in any way (i.e., plagiarism),\\r\\nbut to remove one more unknown from the equation: what it literally feels like to go through the motions of stringing words and sentences and paragraphs\\r\\ntogether to tell a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCLUSIONS & NEXT STEPS\\r\\nA good analysis is repetitive. You know the intricacies of your work in and out,\\r\\nbut your audience does not. You\\u2019ve told your readers in your abstract (or\\r\\nintroduction, if you prefer) what you had ventured to do and even what you end\\r\\nup finding and the content lays this all out for them. In the conclusions\\r\\nsection you hit them with it again. At this point, they\\u2019ve seen the relevant\\r\\ndata you\\u2019ve carefully chosen to support your theory so it\\u2019s time to formally\\r\\ndraw your conclusions. Your readers can decide if they agree or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of being repetitive, after making your conclusions, you again remind\\r\\nyour readers of the objective(s) of this report. Restate them again and help\\r\\nyour readers help you\\u2015what do you expect now? What feedback would you like? What\\r\\ndecision-making can happen now that your report is presented and the insights\\r\\nhave been shared? In my work, I often collaborate with strategists to develop a\\r\\nset of recommendations for our clients. Typically I'll take a stab at it based\\r\\non the expertise I've gained in working with the data and a strategist will\\r\\nrefine using their business insights.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIN\\r\\nAnd this is exactly where the beauty of the analysis and your skillful\\r\\npresentation thereof meet. Because you\\u2019ve managed to package your approach in a\\r\\nfashion digestible to your audience, your readers, collaborators, and clients\\r\\nhave comprehended and learned from your analysis and what its implications are\\r\\nwithout getting lost in the trees. They are equipped to react to the value in\\r\\nyour work and participate in the next step of realizing its objectives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for reading the second entry in this series on communicating data science .

Trying to summarize it ended up being quite long\\r\\n   anyway. A lot of distilled information.\\r\\n   \\r\\n   We work a bit differently. We include an executive summary + recommendations\\r\\n   at the beginning of the presentation instead of putting them at the end, just\\r\\n   after stating the question to answer. After that the audience knows what will\\r\\n   come, and when the presentation is revisited it is a lot faster to check . If\\r\\n   there's a need to dig deeper, there's always available all the analysis\\r\\n   steps.\\r\\n   \\r\\n   Hoping to see the next one soon! \\ud83d\\ude00\\r\\n   \\r\\n    * Megan RisdalThanks! I actually often do the same thing re: executive summaries in my\\r\\n      day job, too! That's a really good point. There's definitely no\\r\\n      one-size-fits-all approach which makes a high-level summarization\\r\\n      misleading in certain ways. And now that I think of it, another strength\\r\\n      in communicating data science is being able to be information dense &\\r\\n      concise for times where you need to fit your work into a standalone one-\\r\\n      or two-sheeter/executive summary.\\r\\n      \\r\\n      Hopefully more good stuff coming soon. \\ud83d\\ude42\\r\\n      \\r\\n      \\r\\n    * \\r\\n   \\r\\n   \\r\\n * \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OFFICIAL BLOG OF KAGGLE.COM\\r\\nSearchCATEGORIES\\r\\n * Data Science News (38)\\r\\n * Kaggle News (120)\\r\\n * Kernels (22)\\r\\n * Tutorials (28)\\r\\n * Winners' Interviews (174)\\r\\n\\r\\nWANT TO SUBSCRIBE?\\r\\nEmail Address * First Name * = required fieldPOPULAR TAGS\\r\\nAlgo Trading Challenge Annual Santa Competition binary classification community computer vision CrowdFlower Search Results Relevance Dark Matter Deloitte diabetes Diabetic Retinopathy EEG data Elo Chess Ratings Competition Eurovision Challenge Facebook Recruiting Flavours of Physics: Finding \\u03c4 \\u2192 \\u03bc\\u03bc\\u03bc Flight Quest Grasp-and-Lift EEG Detection Heritage Health Prize How Much Did It Rain? image classification Intel Kaggle InClass Kernels logistic regression March Mania Merck multiclass classification natural language processing optimization problem Otto Product Classification Owen Zhang Practice Fusion Product Product News Profiling Top Kagglers Recruiting regression problem scikit-learn scripts of the week The Hunt for Prohibited Content Tourism Forecasting Tutorial video series Wikipedia Challenge XGBoostARCHIVES\\r\\nArchives Select Month July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 Toggle the Widgetbar\",\n          \"Skip navigation Sign in SearchLoading...\\r\\n\\r\\nClose Yeah, keep it Undo CloseTHIS VIDEO IS UNAVAILABLE.\\r\\nWATCH QUEUE\\r\\nQUEUE\\r\\nWatch Queue Queue * Remove all\\r\\n * Disconnect\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next video is starting stop 1.
